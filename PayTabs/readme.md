## Introduction

The PayTabs Assignment is a system that emulates a RESTful API for money transfers between accounts. It includes the implementation of data models, endpoints for account listing and transfers, transfer validation, and concurrency handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need the following prerequisites:

- Go programming language installed on your system.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, GoLand).
- Git to clone the repository.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miank/Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the PayTabs assignment directory:

   ```bash
   cd Projects/Assignment/PayTabs
   ```

3. Build and run the Go application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

The application will start, and you will see a message indicating that it is ready to make transfers.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the API endpoints to perform various actions. You can make HTTP requests to these endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or your web browser. Here are the available API endpoints:

## API Endpoints

- `GET /accounts`: List all ingested accounts with updated balances.
   http://localhost:8080/listAccounts

- `POST /transfers`: Transfer money between accounts. The request should include details about the source and destination accounts and the transfer amount.
   http://localhost:8080/transfer

## Testing

The project includes test cases to ensure the API works as expected. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
go test
```

Make sure to update the test cases to match the specifics of your code.
