## Features

- Retrieve car details by ID
- List all available cars
- Create a new car
- Update an existing car's information

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your system
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) package installed (run `go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/miank/Projects.git
   cd go-mux-api
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Go server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Use an API testing tool (e.g., Postman) to test the provided API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

- **GET /cars/{id}**: Retrieve car details by ID
- **GET /cars**: List all cars
- **POST /cars**: Create a new car
- **PUT /cars/{id}**: Update an existing car's information

## Testing

To run the tests, you'll need Ginkgo and Gomega. Install them using:

```bash
go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...
```

Run the tests using Ginkgo:

```bash
ginkgo -v
```
